# Explanation
## general
- Calculations should be done on an ringVar/fieldVar Type
	- That means calcutatory funktions difined in monoide/group fields should be performed on ringVar \*, where val is of the type of the apropriate calculation, and those funktions should return ringVar \*, where the filed/ring field is the same as on the input side.
